# Regional Probers (Multi-Vantage Measurement)

Regional probers provide diversity of measurement:
- different geographies
- different networks/ASNs
- different hosting providers

Purpose:
- avoid single-region blind spots
- strengthen quorum confidence
- reduce the chance of localized censorship/outage masking global health

Outputs:
- raw probe measurements (off-chain)
- aggregated buckets forwarded to verifier nodes for signing
