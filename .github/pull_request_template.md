## Summary

## MVP Impact (What Got More Real)

## End-State Impact (What This Enables Later)

## How To Test

```bash
# Commands you ran
```

## Verification Evidence

- Devnet program ids (if on-chain)
- Devnet tx signatures
- Hashes/proofs (name_hash, dest_hash, PDA addresses) when relevant

## Checklist

- [ ] Docs updated (MVP vs End-State clearly labeled)
- [ ] No build artifacts committed (`target/`, `node_modules/`, ledgers)
- [ ] Devnet/local instructions verified (or explicitly marked blocked)
- [ ] Security note added if auth/keys/permissions were touched
