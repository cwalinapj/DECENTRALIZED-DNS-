# Adapter Examples

These are **non-normative** examples to help developers implement adapters that conform to:

- `specs/backend-interface.md`

Examples include:

- an upstream DNS quorum adapter
- an IPFS gateway adapter
- request/response mapping patterns
- conformance probe patterns

If any example conflicts with the spec, the spec wins.
