## Purpose
This adapter integrates the upstream network or naming system into the DDNS stack.

## Token Swap / OTC
- Eligible partners can offer custodial OTC swaps for client onboarding.
- Flow: client pays -> OTC desk swaps -> credits issued -> adapter routes traffic.
- Settlement can be in native token, USDC, or agreed stable.

## Integration Points
- Resolver routing
- Toll credits / usage ledger
- Optional trust-score hooks

## Operator Opportunity
Partners can grow usage by onboarding DDNS clients, providing routing and caching,
and participating in the OTC swap pipeline.
