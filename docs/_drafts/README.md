# Drafts / Out-of-place Notes

This folder contains material that was previously in `docs/` but appeared to be
notes, placeholders, or early drafts rather than final documentation.

If you are looking for authoritative docs, start with:
- `/Users/root1/scripts/DECENTRALIZED-DNS-/docs/README.md` (if present)
- `/Users/root1/scripts/DECENTRALIZED-DNS-/docs/QUICKSTART.md`
- `/Users/root1/scripts/DECENTRALIZED-DNS-/specs/`

As sections are finalized, move them back into `docs/` and link them from the
root `docs` index.
