# Web2 Pricing Model (USD-first, Web3 rails hidden)

## Default user model

- Users pay a fixed USD price.
- Users do not need crypto to use TollDNS.
- DNS, gateway, hosting, and continuity policy are presented as a standard web product flow.

## Two-lane framing

### Lane A: User story (default)
- Pay in USD.
- Get DNS + gateway + static hosting defaults.
- Get renewal continuity protections (policy-gated).
- Optionally use AI guardrails and developer API/SDK.

### Lane B: Operator / Treasury (advanced)
- Program deployment and rent funding.
- Treasury reserves and runway management.
- Validator strategy (optional).
- Rewards and miner economics.

## Important rent statement

- Rent-exempt lamports are required deposits for Solana accounts/programs.
- Staking does **not** remove rent-exempt requirements.
- Staking is an optional treasury strategy for excess reserves and ongoing ops costs.

## Billing ownership

- User-facing billing remains USD-stable.
- Treasury handles SOL/TOLL/USDC rails, reserve management, and operational funding in the background.
