## User Onboarding (Web2-first)

- No crypto required for users.
- Pricing is fixed in USD.
- You can pay in USD (recommended) or crypto; TollDNS handles settlement/volatility in treasury rails.
- User-facing checkout stays USD-first with stable pricing; crypto is optional and abstracted behind treasury settlement.

Read first:
- `docs/WEB2_PRICING_MODEL.md`
- `docs/PAYMENTS_AND_TREASURY.md`
- `docs/DOMAIN_CONTINUITY.md`

## Quickstart (user-facing)

1. Start the gateway locally:
```bash
npm -C gateway ci
npm -C gateway run build
PORT=8054 npm -C gateway run start
```
2. Request a USD-first quote lock:
```bash
curl 'http://127.0.0.1:8054/v1/pay/quote?sku=renewal-basic&currency=USD'
```
3. Check renewal safety banner state and grace window:
```bash
curl 'http://127.0.0.1:8054/v1/domain/banner?domain=low-traffic.com&format=json'
```
4. Point your domain nameservers to TollDNS to unlock continuity/subsidy eligibility.
5. Keep user billing in USD; optional crypto rails stay behind treasury settlement.

## Pricing that won't surprise you

- renewals should not fail silently
- if payment fails, continuity warning/banner flow activates first
- eligible domains can remain reachable in safe degraded mode while renewal is pending
- policy remains bound by registrar/registry windows

## Developer quick verify

```bash
PORT=8054 npm -C gateway run start
curl 'http://localhost:8054/v1/resolve?name=netflix.com&type=A'
```

## Operator/Developer Proof (advanced)

```bash
npm run mvp:demo:devnet
```

This is internal proof for operators/developers (strict on-chain path), not end-user onboarding.
