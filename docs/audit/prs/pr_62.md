## Why it exists (inferred)
- docs: MVP tokenomics split (TOLL utility + REP miner rewards)
- PR body excerpt:
```text
## What changed\n- Updated MVP docs to make token roles explicit:\n  - **TOLL** = utility/payments only\n  - **REP** = early-adopter miner reward (anti-sybil gated)\n- Added explicit anti-sybil guardrails in narrative: bond, daily cap, diversity minimums, cooldown\n- Updated README with a clear MVP miner rewards section\n\n## Why\nCloud infra is cheap to sybil. Free liquid token mining in MVP is too farmable. REP-first miner rewards preserves early-adopter incentives without opening immediate token-print abuse.\n\n## Scope\nDocs only (no program/service/script changes).\n\n## Files\n- README.md\n- docs/MVP.md\n- docs/ADOPTION.md\n- docs/END_STATE.md\n
```
