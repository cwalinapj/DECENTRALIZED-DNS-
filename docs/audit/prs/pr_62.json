{"baseRefName":"main","body":"## What changed\\n- Updated MVP docs to make token roles explicit:\\n  - **TOLL** = utility/payments only\\n  - **REP** = early-adopter miner reward (anti-sybil gated)\\n- Added explicit anti-sybil guardrails in narrative: bond, daily cap, diversity minimums, cooldown\\n- Updated README with a clear MVP miner rewards section\\n\\n## Why\\nCloud infra is cheap to sybil. Free liquid token mining in MVP is too farmable. REP-first miner rewards preserves early-adopter incentives without opening immediate token-print abuse.\\n\\n## Scope\\nDocs only (no program/service/script changes).\\n\\n## Files\\n- README.md\\n- docs/MVP.md\\n- docs/ADOPTION.md\\n- docs/END_STATE.md\\n","commits":[{"authoredDate":"2026-02-18T09:10:39Z","authors":[{"email":"144741118+cwalinapj@users.noreply.github.com","id":"U_kgDOCKCS_g","login":"cwalinapj","name":"Paul Cwalina"}],"committedDate":"2026-02-18T09:10:39Z","messageBody":"","messageHeadline":"docs: split MVP tokenomics into utility TOLL and REP rewards","oid":"40c41efd9a7814dd3aa8607cd271bce16819784b"}],"files":[{"path":"README.md","additions":7,"deletions":1},{"path":"docs/ADOPTION.md","additions":17,"deletions":6},{"path":"docs/END_STATE.md","additions":8,"deletions":1},{"path":"docs/MVP.md","additions":14,"deletions":3}],"headRefName":"codex/rep-tokenomics-docs","labels":[],"number":62,"statusCheckRollup":[{"__typename":"CheckRun","completedAt":"2026-02-18T09:11:08Z","conclusion":"FAILURE","detailsUrl":"https://github.com/cwalinapj/DECENTRALIZED-DNS-/actions/runs/22133472335/job/63979103977","name":"Docs formatting (markdownlint)","startedAt":"2026-02-18T09:10:57Z","status":"COMPLETED","workflowName":"ci"},{"__typename":"CheckRun","completedAt":"2026-02-18T09:11:05Z","conclusion":"FAILURE","detailsUrl":"https://github.com/cwalinapj/DECENTRALIZED-DNS-/actions/runs/22133472335/job/63979103974","name":"Raspi TS package builds","startedAt":"2026-02-18T09:10:58Z","status":"COMPLETED","workflowName":"ci"},{"__typename":"CheckRun","completedAt":"2026-02-18T09:11:11Z","conclusion":"FAILURE","detailsUrl":"https://github.com/cwalinapj/DECENTRALIZED-DNS-/actions/runs/22133472335/job/63979103871","name":"Compat MVP validation","startedAt":"2026-02-18T09:10:57Z","status":"COMPLETED","workflowName":"ci"},{"__typename":"CheckRun","completedAt":"2026-02-18T09:11:01Z","conclusion":"FAILURE","detailsUrl":"https://github.com/cwalinapj/DECENTRALIZED-DNS-/actions/runs/22133472335/job/63979103913","name":"MVP resolver checks","startedAt":"2026-02-18T09:10:57Z","status":"COMPLETED","workflowName":"ci"},{"__typename":"CheckRun","completedAt":"2026-02-18T09:11:01Z","conclusion":"FAILURE","detailsUrl":"https://github.com/cwalinapj/DECENTRALIZED-DNS-/actions/runs/22133472335/job/63979103902","name":"MVP root tests","startedAt":"2026-02-18T09:10:56Z","status":"COMPLETED","workflowName":"ci"},{"__typename":"CheckRun","completedAt":"2026-02-18T09:10:53Z","conclusion":"SUCCESS","detailsUrl":"https://dashboard.gitguardian.com","name":"GitGuardian Security Checks","startedAt":"2026-02-18T09:10:52Z","status":"COMPLETED","workflowName":""}],"title":"docs: MVP tokenomics split (TOLL utility + REP miner rewards)","url":"https://github.com/cwalinapj/DECENTRALIZED-DNS-/pull/62"}
