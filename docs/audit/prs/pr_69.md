- PR body excerpt:
```text
## What changed
- Wired `ddns_witness_rewards` for devnet use and ensured Program ID consistency (`AVsmrpWU...`).
- Added/updated `solana/scripts/witness_rewards.ts` CLI (init-config, deposit-bond, fund-reward-vault, submit-batch, claim, status).
- Fixed CLI correctness issues: Anchor v0.32 Program constructor signature, IDL path resolution, PDA-owned token account creation, snake_case decoded fields.
- Added devnet proof run to `solana/VERIFIED.md` and updated `docs/WITNESS_REWARDS_MVP.md`.

## Why
We need an end-to-end devnet proof that the program compiles, is deployed, and is usable from a minimal CLI without hardcoded secrets.
