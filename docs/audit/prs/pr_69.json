{"baseRefName":"main","body":"## What changed\n- Wired `ddns_witness_rewards` for devnet use and ensured Program ID consistency (`AVsmrpWU...`).\n- Added/updated `solana/scripts/witness_rewards.ts` CLI (init-config, deposit-bond, fund-reward-vault, submit-batch, claim, status).\n- Fixed CLI correctness issues: Anchor v0.32 Program constructor signature, IDL path resolution, PDA-owned token account creation, snake_case decoded fields.\n- Added devnet proof run to `solana/VERIFIED.md` and updated `docs/WITNESS_REWARDS_MVP.md`.\n\n## Why\nWe need an end-to-end devnet proof that the program compiles, is deployed, and is usable from a minimal CLI without hardcoded secrets.\n\n## Commands run (local)\n```bash\ncd solana\ncargo metadata --no-deps\ncargo check -p ddns_witness_rewards\nanchor build --program-name ddns_witness_rewards\ncargo test -p ddns_witness_rewards\n```\n\n## Devnet proof (tx sigs)\n- Program deploy tx: `3iwB8SUTej49FCstVCZJJzv7FDgJBEx4TDYi2bxpaXtiGS2eScouWQaTQYeokMivZmhmS4Af8CtTNUHECXVrZKT8`\n- init-config: `RVwtCZuVVE4bGnDj16yDB11bNXzQQZr6XaDk8o1gpiAt1DLVkXusau5UYimoyksxjdbK6gmiyNJpeMpzQspMjM4`\n- deposit-bond: `F2QUhe1LYnQf5KXcGFBdATMwKK3phajE9MsF7RrnjjrqhKijXK5DiHRKA5PyBYY9WG1wcec24kd99NBaRCCv6cF`\n- fund-reward-vault: `3pzZpTjsWCmyArTBAF7fm3z74y6t9DCj33AhVZ8T4S7886wDnJyVoELpj4oxqFNDhdUzkTYo2Vtbi7yVZeYjBkAh`\n- submit-batch: `5MBo9DX2vok6vzyCj6whk4acPjVjeeXCVgrxccS5qXEUcxfeYd1LH1cCwqJ3Wq5zbagfUEvufLUR2kwkuYfEy1c9`\n- claim: `5LvyAUyekZLTgo5PPSvqDNHyXbn9rkUrKpkH2nrgAppBYJK5qtTcwhuMgo2tK2eAzGXzctocsHuMsKBT5UgTxzWN`\n\nFull PDA list + `solana account` proof commands: `solana/VERIFIED.md`.\n\n## Security notes\n- No keypair JSON files or `.env` files added.\n- CLI defaults to `ANCHOR_WALLET=~/.config/solana/id.json` (not committed).\n- Program is permissionless/bond-gated;
