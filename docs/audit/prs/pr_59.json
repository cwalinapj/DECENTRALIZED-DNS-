{"baseRefName":"main","body":"## What changed\n- Added `scripts/merge_prs_one_by_one.sh` with strict merge guardrails.\n- Added `docs/MERGE_QUEUE.md` and `docs/MERGE_LOG.md`.\n- Updated root `README.md` with \"How merges work (Codex-managed)\".\n\n## Policy behavior implemented\n- Abort on dirty/conflicted repo state (`MERGE_HEAD`, `REBASE_HEAD`, `CHERRY_PICK_HEAD`, or non-empty `git status --porcelain`).\n- Abort when `main` CI is not green.\n- Per-PR flow:\n  1. Confirm PR is OPEN and base is `main`.\n  2. Wait on `gh pr checks --watch`.\n  3. Create isolated worktree, rebase, run local-equivalent checks.\n  4. Stop at `READY TO MERGE` unless `OVERRIDE_MERGE_OK` is set.\n- Append run results to `docs/MERGE_LOG.md` (including dry-run runs).\n\n## Dry-run verification\n- Command run: `./scripts/merge_prs_one_by_one.sh --dry-run --label ddns-merge-queue`\n- Observed output: `ERROR: main CI is not green (latest: failure).`\n- Appended to log in `docs/MERGE_LOG.md` as `blocked`.\n","commits":[{"authoredDate":"2026-02-18T08:35:31Z","authors":[{"email":"144741118+cwalinapj@users.noreply.github.com","id":"U_kgDOCKCS_g","login":"cwalinapj","name":"Paul Cwalina"}],"committedDate":"2026-02-18T08:35:31Z","messageBody":"","messageHeadline":"ops: add strict merge guardrails workflow and queue docs","oid":"68266190a26fa7d6919862c1da8c20a313681bf0"},{"authoredDate":"2026-02-18T08:35:55Z","authors":[{"email":"144741118+cwalinapj@users.noreply.github.com","id":"U_kgDOCKCS_g","login":"cwalinapj","name":"Paul Cwalina"}],"committedDate":"2026-02-18T08:35:55Z","messageBody":"","messageHeadline":"ops: fix merge guardrails dry-run PR collection logging","oid":"961125ba61c90c338489f4832b83b01f122bc8e3"},{"authoredDate":"2026-02-18T08:37:41Z","authors":[{"email":"144741118+cwalinapj@users.noreply.github.com","id":"U_kgDOCKCS_g","login":"cwalinapj","name":"Paul Cwalina"}],"committedDate":"2026-02-18T08:37:41Z","messageBody":"","messageHeadline":"ops: enforce strict guarded PR workflow with queue and merge log docs","oid":"93e86eb50ab2159768a8f653db981be082554735"},{"authoredDate":"2026-02-18T08:37:58Z","authors":[{"email":"144741118+cwalinapj@users.noreply.github.com","id":"U_kgDOCKCS_g","login":"cwalinapj","name":"Paul Cwalina"}],"committedDate":"2026-02-18T08:37:58Z","messageBody":"","messageHeadline":"ops: record dry-run guardrails execution in merge log","oid":"60472e8c78cf578b4aa5d4f7ecfa21d0c8940a80"},{"authoredDate":"2026-02-18T08:38:44Z","authors":[{"email":"144741118+cwalinapj@users.noreply.github.com","id":"U_kgDOCKCS_g","login":"cwalinapj","name":"Paul Cwalina"}],"committedDate":"2026-02-18T08:38:44Z","messageBody":"","messageHeadline":"ops: append additional guardrails dry-run log entry","oid":"6f09c13cb5e5b48027f25ff7df19dcfa40457548"}],"files":[{"path":"README.md","additions":9,"deletions":1},{"path":"docs/MERGE_LOG.md","additions":25,"deletions":0},{"path":"docs/MERGE_QUEUE.md","additions":15,"deletions":0},{"path":"scripts/merge_prs_one_by_one.sh","additions":221,"deletions":0}],"headRefName":"codex/merge-guardrails-policy","labels":[],"number":59,"statusCheckRollup":[{"__typename":"CheckRun","completedAt":"2026-02-18T08:39:05Z","conclusion":"FAILURE","detailsUrl":"https://github.com/cwalinapj/DECENTRALIZED-DNS-/actions/runs/22132518799/job/63975885472","name":"Docs formatting (markdownlint)","startedAt":"2026-02-18T08:38:53Z","status":"COMPLETED","workflowName":"ci"},{"__typename":"CheckRun","completedAt":"2026-02-18T08:39:02Z","conclusion":"FAILURE","detailsUrl":"https://github.com/cwalinapj/DECENTRALIZED-DNS-/actions/runs/22132518799/job/63975885475","name":"Raspi TS package builds","startedAt":"2026-02-18T08:38:54Z","status":"COMPLETED","workflowName":"ci"},{"__typename":"CheckRun","completedAt":"2026-02-18T08:38:59Z","conclusion":"FAILURE","detailsUrl":"https://github.com/cwalinapj/DECENTRALIZED-DNS-/actions/runs/22132518799/job/63975885487","name":"Compat MVP validation","startedAt":"2026-02-18T08:38:54Z","status":"COMPLETED","workflowName":"ci"},{"__typename":"CheckRun","completedAt":"2026-02-18T08:39:00Z","conclusion":"FAILURE","detailsUrl":"https://github.com/cwalinapj/DECENTRALIZED-DNS-/actions/runs/22132518799/job/63975885439","name":"MVP resolver checks","startedAt":"2026-02-18T08:38:53Z","status":"COMPLETED","workflowName":"ci"},{"__typename":"CheckRun","completedAt":"2026-02-18T08:39:02Z","conclusion":"FAILURE","detailsUrl":"https://github.com/cwalinapj/DECENTRALIZED-DNS-/actions/runs/22132518799/job/63975885440","name":"MVP root tests","startedAt":"2026-02-18T08:38:53Z","status":"COMPLETED","workflowName":"ci"},{"__typename":"CheckRun","completedAt":"2026-02-18T08:39:01Z","conclusion":"SUCCESS","detailsUrl":"https://dashboard.gitguardian.com","name":"GitGuardian Security Checks","startedAt":"2026-02-18T08:38:49Z","status":"COMPLETED","workflowName":""}],"title":"ops: strict merge guardrails + one-at-a-time PR workflow","url":"https://github.com/cwalinapj/DECENTRALIZED-DNS-/pull/59"}
