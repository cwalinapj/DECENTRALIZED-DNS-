```text
## What changed
- Added new Anchor program `ddns_miner_score` for per-epoch miner stats, scoring, dominance penalty, and on-chain reward claiming (TOLL transfers from a vault).
- Added devnet-ready script `solana/scripts/miner_score.ts` (init-config/report/finalize/set-reward/claim/penalize) with env/Anchor.toml program id discovery (no hardcoded IDs).
- Added localnet test `solana/tests/ddns_miner_score.ts` covering: report stats -> finalize epoch -> set rewards -> penalize -> claim -> replay rejection.
- Added MVP bootstrap service `services/miner-witness` endpoint `POST /v1/report-epoch-stats` to submit stats on-chain (allowlisted submitter model).
- Docs: `docs/MINER_SCORING.md` + short `docs/MVP.md` / `docs/END_STATE.md`, and linked from root README + docs index.
- Set `solana/Anchor.toml` provider cluster to `localnet` to prevent accidental devnet deploys during `anchor test`.
